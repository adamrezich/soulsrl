1. OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoulsRL is an attempt at mashing up roguelike gameplay and conventions with some
of the ideas of FROM Software's Dark Souls. Specifically, instead of having
permadeath, like most roguelikes, SoulsRL uses the Dark Souls death mechanic,
where you find bonfires, and dying respawns you back at the last bonfire you
visited, but all enemies respawn.


2. GAMEPLAY BASICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To move your character around the world, you can use the arrow keys, the numpad,
or vi keys. Using the numpad or vi keys is more efficient, because it gives you
access to diagonal movement.

Here's how the numpad and vi keys work:

                              numpad       vi keys

                              7 8 9         y k u
                               \|/           \|/
                              4-+-6         h-+-l
                               /|\           /|\
                              1 2 3         b j n

SoulsRL is a turn-based game. <Right now, the turn-based-ness of it sucks and a
good, actual, turn-based system will be implemented eventually. For now, you go,
then every other creature goes in an arbitrary order.> <TODO: More on turn
system as it develops.>

To interact with most things, simply "move into" them. For example, when you see
an enemy, move adjacent to them, and then "try to move into their square." This
will cause your character to attack them.

The same goes for opening doors. Opening doors usually takes a full turn, and
you obviously have to open a door before you move through it.

As things happen in the game, messages describing them will appear in your
message log. Messages disappear as soon as you press most any key, so if you
want to go back and read the log of all messages that've come up in the game,
press Shift+M.

Sometimes, in a single round of turns, or between times when you are allowed to
take an action (i.e. if you're stunned), more messages will come up than can fit
in the three-line message output at the top of the screen. When this happens,
the last line of the last message will say "[MORE]" at the end, and you'll have
to press the Spacebar to proceed.
