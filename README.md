SoulsRL
=======

An unconventional, browser-based roguelike.

public/js/rle.js is RLE, "Roguelike Engine," basically, an HTML5 canvas fake curses thing.

public/js/game.js is where the actual game stuff is.

public/js/fov.js is an FOV engine thing I stole from [this RogueBasin page](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php/Permissive_Field_of_View_in_Javascript).

public/js/crow.mini.js is [CrowLib](https://github.com/nanodeath/CrowLib).
